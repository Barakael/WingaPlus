**⚠️ Note:** You cannot delete categories that have products assigned to them. Remove products from the category first.

## 🛡️ Category Protection

### Default Categories
- **Cannot be deleted** (system protection)
- Can be edited if needed
- Always available for all shops

### Custom Categories
- Can be freely edited or deleted
- Deletion blocked if products exist in category
- Shop-specific (not shared between shops)

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Use Default Categories First
Start with Phones, Laptops, and Accessories before creating custom ones.

### 2. Keep Categories Broad
Instead of "iPhone 15 Cases", use "Accessories" and differentiate in product names.

### 3. Consistent Naming
Use proper capitalization: "Power Banks" not "power banks" or "POWER BANKS"

### 4. Add Descriptions
Help your team understand what belongs in each category:
- ✅ "Smartwatches - Fitness trackers and smartwatch devices"
- ❌ "Smartwatches" (no description)

### 5. Don't Over-Categorize
Too many categories make it harder to manage. Keep it simple!

### 6. Regular Cleanup
Review categories monthly and merge similar ones.

## 📊 Using Categories for Products

### When Adding a Product:
1. Select from existing categories dropdown
2. If needed category doesn't exist, go to Settings → Categories to add it first
3. Assign the appropriate category

### Benefits:
